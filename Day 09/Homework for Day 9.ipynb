    "\n",
    "One Major usage of Matrices is to solve Linear Equations. This is extremely uesful for linear programming optimization problems and other similar things, and you can definitely use this technique for various daily math problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "On doing the matrix computation below, you will see that it is the same as the 2 linear equations $a_1 x + b_1 y = c_1$ and $a_2 x + b_2 y = c_2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\begin{bmatrix} a_1 & b_1 \\\\ a_2 & b_2 \\end{bmatrix} \\times \\begin{bmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix}c_1\\\\c_2\\end{bmatrix}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, if we want the value of $\\begin{bmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{bmatrix}$, we need to premultiply both sides of this equation with the inverse of the first matrix:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\begin{bmatrix} a_1 & b_1 \\\\ a_2 & b_2 \\end{bmatrix}^{-1} \\times \\begin{bmatrix} a_1 & b_1 \\\\ a_2 & b_2 \\end{bmatrix} \\times \\begin{bmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} a_1 & b_1 \\\\ a_2 & b_2 \\end{bmatrix}^{-1} \\times\\begin{bmatrix}c_1\\\\c_2\\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{bmatrix}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, solving linear equations now becomes a simple task of just multiplying matrices! No more \"add this equation to that equation\", and definitely fewer silly mistakes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you will need to take some inputs from the user and create a linear equation solver.\n",
